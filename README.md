## Coursera Capstone Project - Restaurant data
_Introduction_

One of the major pitfalls before venturing on a project/starting business is not performing sufficient market research. It is crucial step to forge the success of any business venture. You need to gather information about your competitors; get a grasp of the customer base and possible growth. This can be applied to restaurants as well. Location and customer base are two key components to a restaurants success. You do not wish to have a restaurant where customers will not be interested. You also do not wish to have a restaurant serving the same type of cuisine in an area where there may be several restaurants with the same type of cusine. Hence having information with regards to which areas have what kind of restaurants, will give you an edge to make informed decision on where to setup the restaurants and what type of cuisine to offer.

_Data_

We will be using geospatial data of the Toronto area to first cluster them into different boroughs using K-means cluster method. After this we will be using the Foursquare API location data to gather restaurant cuisines in different neighbourhoods.  There after we can explore the most common restaurants in every neighborhood contained within each cluster.
